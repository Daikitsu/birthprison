        Hey Nils! Happy Birthday, man. I've been aware of your existence in Ici's server for quite a while, but we've only really started interacting with each other this year, and I'm so glad I decided to! You're fun to talk to, and I'm really glad we were able to share a common interest in one of my favorite stories. I really enjoyed your Blue Archive streams and your insightful commentary on the characters and plot. Your birthday is a perfect occasion to celebrate the great person you are. I hope this day brings you all the joy and happiness you deserve. May it be filled with laughter, love, and maybe a few surprise moments that make it truly special. Here's to another 60 years. Cheers!

        It‚Äôs time to get corny hehe happy birthday Mr.Professor !!! !

        <br>It‚Äôs been already about 2 years since I‚Äôve met our local green cat, and it feels both like it was yesterday, and like it‚Äôs been ages by now. I remember being drawn to you by this special spark of yours, and it‚Äôs still as bright as the first day. Whenever you are around, I just know I'll have the best time, because you make people feel loved and cared for, and I‚Äôll always be grateful for your kindness. In return, I wish for you to always be able to find a glimmer of hope, pampering you with the same fondness people think of you with. 

        <br>We love and cherish you, you silly cat.
